warn:  The Least Perceptive Literary Critic
warn:  	The most important critic in our field of study is Lord Halifax.  A
warn:  most individual judge of poetry, he once invited Alexander Pope round to
warn:  give a public reading of his latest poem.
warn:  	Pope, the leading poet of his day, was greatly surprised when Lord
warn:  Halifax stopped him four or five times and said, "I beg your pardon, Mr.
warn:  Pope, but there is something in that passage that does not quite please me."
warn:  	Pope was rendered speechless, as this fine critic suggested sizeable
warn:  and unwise emendations to his latest masterpiece.  "Be so good as to mark
warn:  the place and consider at your leisure.  I'm sure you can give it a better
warn:  turn."
warn:  	After the reading, a good friend of Lord Halifax, a certain Dr.
warn:  Garth, took the stunned Pope to one side.  "There is no need to touch the
warn:  lines," he said.  "All you need do is leave them just as they are, call on
warn:  Lord Halifax two or three months hence, thank him for his kind observation
warn:  on those passages, and then read them to him as altered.  I have known him
warn:  much longer than you have, and will be answerable for the event."
warn:  	Pope took his advice, called on Lord Halifax and read the poem
warn:  exactly as it was before.  His unique critical faculties had lost none of
warn:  their edge.  "Ay", he commented, "now they are perfectly right.  Nothing can
warn:  be better."
